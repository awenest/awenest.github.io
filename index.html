        <p class="wow tada" data-wow-delay="3s">Yes ! that's me when i was 6-7 probably . I don't remember . This habit of not remembring and forgetting everything is there since i used to be like this . Well , i remember one thing that this used to be one of my favorite dresses . Sometimes ,  I feel to go back to  that childhood phase of mine .  No fear of grades , career , ladki ,etc etc ! The most important thing was that I didnt took anything/anyone seriously and I could be hurt only by my parent's growling at me :p . It was an awesome phase indeed where u would just play , enjoy and most importantly laugh a lot ! </p></div></div></div>

              <p class="wow tada" data-wow-delay="3s"> So this was the time when I wished to grow as soon as possible since i wanted to feel how those feel when they pass intermediate. I was not aware of the fact that the things which I am dealing with now will bring utmost happiness and smile on my face when I"ll try to recall them . I used to be a quiet studious boy in the start but I did try to enjoy whenever time and mood allowed . Though people called mr studious I used to be very naughty and had the ability of flirting inbuilt in me . Time passed , few people came , few went and sooner I came to realise about a coaching which used to be very popular . I didnt know why was i joining it , I realised the motive of coaching and the meaning of name 'IITJEE' after I had finished two years in FIITJEE . Every day I went to coaching I imagined  of how happy i will be visiting the same place when i woud clear the so called toughest exam of century 'IITJEE' . Sooner ,  the imagination became reality and I was crying in happiness when I passed through the same roads to get awarded for my perfomance. Life doesnt alway tells you what delivery you are going to face from its unpredictable bag of grief and happiness. However, irrespective of what it delivers , it will leave you amazed. </p></div>

              <p class="wow tada" data-wow-delay="3s"> So had i known earlier through what circumstances and enigmatic tasks I had to through in Engineering I must have thought twice . Athough , It's great to be an engineer , it makes you believe in yourself and be independent . It teaches us how to deal with any problem whether on paper or in life .There are very few persons in my life but whosoever they are , they mean the world to me . My eagerness and wish to enjoy life has gone to another level . I never think twice when it comes to enjoying life not always with friends but alone too. Lastly, I would say anyone that can stop you from doing anything is YOU yourself .</p></div></div></div>
